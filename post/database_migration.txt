To resolve this issue, you need to perform a database migration which will include this new field in your `comment` table. Flask-Migrate is a great extension that handles SQLAlchemy database migrations for Flask applications. It provides a command line interface to handle migrations.

Here's how you can set it up:

1. Install Flask-Migrate:

```bash
pip install Flask-Migrate
```

2. Import and initialize it in your application:

```python
from flask_migrate import Migrate

migrate = Migrate(app, db)
```

3. Now you can use the `flask db` command to manage your database:

```bash
flask db init  # Creates a new migration repository
flask db migrate  # Generates an automatic migration script
flask db upgrade  # Applies the migration to the database
```

The `migrate` command will generate a migration script for you to review. In this case, it should contain the addition of-
-the `parent_id` field to the `comment` table. The `upgrade` command will apply this migration to the database.

Remember to run these commands every time you make a change to your database models.
